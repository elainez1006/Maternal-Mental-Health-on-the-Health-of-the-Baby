# Effects of Maternal Mental Health on the Health of the baby
Mental wellbeing has changed drastically during COVID-19, which may have effects on children born during this period due to the epigenetic alterations. It is shown that mothers with a high Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) results have children weighing 0-8% less compared to the average weight of 3,463 grams. Using data from a 2024 study, I seek to find a correlation between maternal mental health and health of the baby during COVID-19. I modeled a linear relationship of the EPDS results, ranging from integers 0-30, and baby mass in grams.
