    "text": "Mental well-being has changed drastically during COVID-19, which may have effects on children born during this period due to the epigenetic alterations. As mental well-being may be linked to degrees of education, I sought to find any correlations between maternal education, mental well-being, and baby weight. Using a public data from 2024, I found that mothers with higher EPDS results tend to be 0-8% less compared to the average weight of 3,463 grams. Additionally, maternal education did not have any significant impact on the baby’s weight."
