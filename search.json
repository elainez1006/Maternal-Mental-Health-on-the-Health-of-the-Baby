It is shown that mothers with a high Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) may increase the risk on the baby. Using data from a 2024 study, I seek to find a correlation between maternal mental health and health of the baby during COVID-19. After modeling baby weight based on EPDS, I found that mothers with higher EPDS results tend to be 0-8% less compared to the average weight of 3,463 grams"
