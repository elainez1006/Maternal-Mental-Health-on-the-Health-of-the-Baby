It is shown that mothers with a high Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) results have children weighing 0-8% less compared to the average weight of 3,463 grams. Using data from a 2024 study, I seek to find a correlation between maternal mental health and health of the baby during COVID-19. I modeled a linear relationship of the EPDS results, ranging from integers 0-30, and baby mass in grams.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharacteristic\nBeta\n95% CI\n1\n\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n3,463\n3,414, 3,511\n\n\nPROMIS_Anxiety\n1.7\n-2.3, 5.8\n\n\nEPDS\n-3.6\n-8.0, 0.69\n\n\nThreaten_Baby_Danger\n-0.99\n-1.5, -0.44\n\n\n\n1\nCI = Credible Interval"
